# CS2AutoScreenshot
This app will load a VMAP and read all of the point_cameras from it, then create a list of console commands which when pasted into the console, will take screenshots of the map from the perspective of every point_camera it found.

- Screenshots will be saved in:
`game\csgo_addons\ADDON_NAME\screenshots\CS2AutoScreenshot\MAP_NAME - DATE`
notice it is saved in the GAME folder and not CONTENT!
- It is recommended that you kick all bots before running the command.
- Changing the FOV of the point_camera entity is supported.
